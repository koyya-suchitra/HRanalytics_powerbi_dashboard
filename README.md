Excited to share my new "Comprehensive HR Insights Dashboard" developed using Power BI! ðŸ“Š

Delving into HR data, I extracted valuable insights through a range of visualizations. Here are some key metrics highlighted in the dashboard:

- Employee Count by Department
- Gender Distribution by Department
- Age Spread of Staff
- Min/Max/Average Salary in Each Department
- Top Earners in Each Country
- Performance Spread
- Company Growth Trend
- Employee Filter (by Starting Letter)
- Performance vs. Salary Relationship
- India vs. New Zealand - Quick Scorecard

Utilizing various visual elements like clustered bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter charts, cards, slicers, and tables, this dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the workforce. It's a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

The dashboard also includes interactive features, allowing users to filter data by various criteria such as department, country, and performance ratings. This interactivity enables deeper insights and more precise analysis

Excited to showcase my skills in HR data analysis and Power BI through this project! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
